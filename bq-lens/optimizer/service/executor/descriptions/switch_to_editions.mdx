To reduce costs, consider switching from on-demand to a capacity-based analysis pricing model.

##### How do we estimate savings?

We collect the total slot hours and scanned data for all on-demand BigQuery jobs from the
last 90 days in projects not covered by reservations. Based on this data, we apply the
BigQuery editions pricing models to calculate potential savings. If the estimated savings
are equal to or greater than $100 per year, we recommend switching to BigQuery editions.
